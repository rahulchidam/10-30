<li> 1. Samantha Crawford
<center><font size="3"> "I was skeptical going into Christie and Chris's cooking cabin because of the lack of experience I had in cooking. The classes they provide made it so easy and fun to learn because of the high patience and expertise they displayed. I loved the experience and would recommend it greatly!"</font></center>
<br>
</br>
<li> 2. Nicholas Johnson
<center><font size="3"> "The products they offer are extremely high quality and have shown no signs of wear even after cooking the most demanding dishes. I will continue to buy from them."</font></center>
<br>
</br>
<li> 3. Kelsey Smith
<center><font size="3"> "As someone who has cooked for more than 10 years, I can confidently say that I am still learning new things from Christie and Chris's cooking cabin. Their culinary skills help me become a better cook and I couldn't be happier."</font></center>
